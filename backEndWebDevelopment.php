                    <p>In the 5th week of Web Development with PHP/MySQL, our assignment was to create a login form.  I created a form to login to a bicycle forum I named, &quot;Cycling in the USA&quot;.  The assignment was about back-end server code, so I made my form verify an email before allowing the user to log in.</p>

                    <p>This was the fourth lab assignment; select 1 - 12 paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum paragraphs.  Behind the scene, paragraphs are stored in an array variable, and then outputs the selected number of paragraphs.</p>

                    <p>In week 7 of Web Development with PHP/MySQL, our assignment was to create a function machine.  It was more practice with math and string operators, and creating functions to call built-built-in functions.  The assignment was fun and involved internal programming including creating functions that perform operations with numbers or strings and back-end server validation.</p>

                    <p>In week 4 of Web Development with PHP/MySQL, our assignment was to create a form for string input of 5 or more words.  We practised some back-end PHP string manipulation methods, and output the results.  Furthermore, we listed the 15 most populous cities in America, per 2017, and sorted them by both population and name; more PHP string manipulation.</p>

                    <p>In week 10 of Web Development with PHP/MySQL, our assignment was to create registration/login forms for a website, with edit and delete abilities for the MySQL Database.  I called the website cycle forums, and happy for the opportunity to work with MySQL!</p>
