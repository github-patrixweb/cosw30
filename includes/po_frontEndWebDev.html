                    <h3>A tribute to <a href="http://patrixweb.herokuapp.com/cosw20/project/Tribute/" target="_blank">John Kemp Starley</a> for inventing the Rover Saftey Bicycle</h3>

                    <p>This tribute project was an excellent learning experience of both web publishing and history.  Looking back I see responsive methods I used that are out dated.  My skills have improved as a result of being in Front End Website Development. </p>

                    <p>Instead of using a textbook, we used CodeSchool.  They were recently purchased
                        by Pluralsight, but I have an old report card from CodeSchool.  11 Courses Completed:</p>

                    <h3>Web Animation of a <a href="http://patrixweb.herokuapp.com/cosw20/lab/week_8/" target="_blank">Scalable Vector Graphic &#40;SVG&#41;</a></h3>

                    <p>Using CSS web animation techniques, we manipulate objects, such as this SVG monster. SVG is completely drawn using HTML.  Advantages include an image that is scalable and looks as good enlarged.  Disadvantages include HTML code becoming larger and difficult to manage.</p>
                    <h3>Static Scalable Vector Graphics &#40;SVGs&#41;</h3>

                    <p>We drew four SVGs for practice.  <a href="http://patrixweb.herokuapp.com/cosw20/lab/week_9/" target="_blank">This page</a> displays the four I drew.  Note that drawing a SVG is mathematical, so it is different than using pen and paper.  Also, the fourth image I created in a graphic app and exported to SVG.  With a more complex drawing, exporting is the sound solution.</p>

                    <p>For an emerging technology, I choose to write a webpage about <a href="http://patrixweb.herokuapp.com/cosw20/project/SEO/" target="_blank">SEO &#40;search engine optimization&#41;</a>.    I took several years off from developing web pages, but now that I am doing it again, it is good to learn the modern SEO techniques.  Clients expect results and I enjoy delivering them.    </p>
                    <p>Discovering some of the new search algorithms used today was excellent research.  I also noted which techniques are still in use.  Lastly, I shared knowledge from my research in a class presentation.  Knowledge is power and sharing it is wonderful.</p>
