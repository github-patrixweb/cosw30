            <p>In 2015 I enrolled in Long Beach City College.

            <p>Updating my web development skills at LBCC has been amazing!  The internet was released to the public in 1993, and my development in the field began a couple years later, in 1995.  From the humble beginning, to what it has evolved into today, the Internet is an example of science fiction becoming reality.  Learning the skills required for web development today has been beneficial!
