               <p>In our spring 2018 Content Management Systems Class, we set up a WordPress Site.  WP is the number one <span id="tooltip"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">CMS<acronym>Content Management Systems</acronym></a></span>, and about 30% of websites on the Internet are powered by WordPress.  My site, Cycling: DIY Maintenance and Repair, is no longer active, but while in the class, I setup another WordPress Site, <a href="https://www.industrialpolymersllc.com/" title="Industrial Polymers, LLC" target="_blank">Industrial Polymers, LLC</a>.  The purpose of each student setting up a WP Site was to become familiar with CMS, and because I cycle and do my own maintenance and repair, I thought it would be fun to set up a cycling maintenance and repair BLOG.</p>
            <p>After setup, we customized the settings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>added images</li>
                <li>added navigation</li>
                <li>updated all default text</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>Next we added plugins.  I used plugins like: contact form, social sharing, forum, and user submitting post or joining the site all from the front end.</p>
            <p>Moving forward, we tested adding users in the back-end.  It is a powerful feature for assigning roles to website editors, but for subscribers it is more realistic to allow them to sign-up <i>via</i> the front end.</p>
            <p>And then we explored themes, and how they support the content.  I used a theme called Responsive; it supports my content well, and I can use it as a starting point when I write custom server scripts for the theme support files.  I haven't started yet, but it seems logical to me since I've successfully done those types of things 25 years.</p>
            <p>Standard post data types are great, but not always enough so we used a plugin to customize the database fields and the theme.  I've been working on databases 25 years and wrote custom output pages when I was a professional back-end database programmer, so I appreciate all the technical things the plugin does behind the scenes.</p>
            <p>Finally, we added SEO and Analytic plugins.  I'm looking forward to seeing positive results using them...</p>
