            <li>1883 their products were branded as Rovers. </li>
            <li>1885 he made history when he produced the Rover Safety Bicycle.<img src="images/1885_Rover_safety_bicycle.jpg" alt="1885 Rover Safety Bicycle" class="bio">  It featured 2 matching size wheels with a chain transferring power from the cranks to the rear wheel, and the diamond frame you see on the roads today.</li>
            <li>1889 the company became J. K. Stanley &amp; Co Ltd <img src="images/JK_StarleyAndCo_Ltd_advertisement.jpg" alt="J.K. Stanely and Co Ltd advertisement" class="bio">until the late 1890â€™s when it changed to the Rover Cycle Company Ltd.

            <p>A human powered cycle has roots in 1418.  It was about 400 years later when bicycles started becoming popular for transportation, but an English inventor, John Kemp Starley, modernized the design to what is still mainstream today.</p>
            
            <p>His greatest contribution to society was in 1885 when he marketed the original Rover Safety Bicycle.</p>
            
            <p>A decade earlier he invented the tangent-spoked wheel (1874).</p>
            
            <p>After his death, his company evolved to manufacturing motorcycles, and then automobiles.  This was possible from his contributions such as ball bearings.</p>
