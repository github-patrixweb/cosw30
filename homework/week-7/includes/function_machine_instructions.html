        Function Machine Description.
    </summary>
        <p>Function Machine processes numbers and outputs the absolute value of one of four math  operations based on user selection: multiplication &#40;&#42;&#41;, division &#40;&#92;&#41;, addition &#40;&#43;&#41;, or subtraction &#40;&#45;&#41;.  Function Machine can also accept string input and shuffle the string or count the characters.  The four possible math operations are input <em>via</em> the first form, and the remaining string procedures are submitted using the second form. </p>
        <h3>Input types: numbers or string.</h3>
        <p>Function Machine now uses two forms to separate numeric and string input.  The two forms are clearly labeled as to which type of input is used.  When math is selected, two numeric inputs and an operator are required, but when a string process is selected, only one input string and operator are required. </p>
